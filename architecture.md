## Architecting of infrastructure, applications and services.

**Project description:** I have worked as a software engineer on numerous projects requiring overall system design, architecting cloud services for a myriad of industries, also writing big-data applications which have tons of variation in how the data is delivered, presented, and memory constraints.  Here is a few projects that were worth delving into:



### 1. Consumer facing, high volume microservices on AWS.

Working as a fullstack engineer on a popular cloud connected product. Volume of incoming messages was on order of 10k+ per min.
Using Kinesis, we are able to "chunk" the inputs into manageable sizes to parse and process.  There is a tradeoff between velocity and volume being considered here.  Here the design was put into production, during initial rollout of these cloud connected products:

API Gateway
Kinesis streams
NoSQL

### 2. Big-data and stream processing architectures and workflows.
